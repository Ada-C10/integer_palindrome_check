# Integer Palindrome Check
Check if the digits in a non-negative integer form a palindrome.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method that checks if the digits in the input positive integer forms a palindrome. The method returns true if the digits in the input form a palindrome. The method returns false otherwise.
* For example, 12521 and 4554 are palindromes. 326725 is not a palindrome.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution.
* If you think of multiple approaches to solve the problem, implement the solution which minimizes space complexity. Explain the other approaches, and your decision in comments above the code.
